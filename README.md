    - Venue characteristics (e.g., altitude, location).
    - Betting-related inputs (e.g., betting odds, over/under rounds).
    - Referee tendencies (e.g., stricter or lenient officiating style).
### 3. Model Training and Testing
  - Train your model using data up to March 2024.
  - Use fight results from April 2024 to present for testing the model.
### 4. Model Outputs
  - Winner (Probability)
  - Method (Probability)
  - Round (Probability)
